#Ethora (Dappros Platform) API

This section will be useful for developers who are looking to:
1) Better understand how our server applications work
2) Extend their apps functionality beyond the code currently available in Ethora client engines (React Native for iOS/Android and React.js for Web)
3) Interact with their apps and server data through their own 3rd party logic (for example, import/export users with your legacy system via Users API etc), create their own server extensions, chat bots etc
