Startups, communities and enterprises come to use Ethora engine so they can deliver their MVP (minimum viable product) app quickly, within DAYS as opposed to months or even years when building a similar functionality from scratch. This engine is fully production ready too, powering multiple projects live in Apple and Google appstores. Backend: comes with a generous free tier (Dappros Platform). Self-hosted (AWS marketplace) and enterprise-grade SLA options available. Experimental 'no backend' (Ethereum and Polygon) versions available too.

## License and Open-source roadmap ‚öñÔ∏è

AUTHORS. Ethora and its server infrastructure (Dappros Platform, chat & push services etc) have been developed since 2018 by <a href="https://www.dappros.com/">Dappros</a> and <a href="http://deepxhub.com/">DeepX</a>. The team is lead by Taras Filatov, a Ukrainian-born and UK based tech entrepreneur.

LICENSE. The project codebase of Ethora developed by the project contributors is released under AGPL license which facilitates open-source distribution and contributions. Other licenses (commercial closed source, SaaS, perpetual etc) can be obtained from the authors. 

GOVERNANCE. The project is currently governed and commercialized by Dappros Ltd (UK). In the long term, we aim to transform the platform into an open protocol funded through an infrastructure utility token economy, governed via an open DAO and developed by contributors worldwide via a system of open R&D grants. You can help fulfil this vision by promoting the project and becoming one of the contributors.

BACKEND. The server-side functionality of Ethora is provided by Dappros Platform API and DeepX RTC infrastructure. Under the bonnet, it consists of Ethereum blockchain network, an API wrapper and caching layer interacting with Ethereum nodes and S3/IPFS storage (built with Node.js, Apache Kafka, Reddit and MongoDB), as well as XMPP-based Ejabberd messaging server with our own custom-built services (such as Push Notifications, blockchain identities integration etc) built with Erlang, Mnesia, MySQL and Cassandra. 

When using Ethora engine, your default backend option is to <a href="https://www.dappros.com/pricing/">sign up</a> for a free account of Dappros Platform. This provides backend infrastructure for your application(s) including Users, Wallets, Tokens, Chat/Messaging etc. You will be using Cloud option this way which is the easiest option, however self-hosted (AWS Marketplace) and dedicated infrastructure managed by us are also available. 

## Commercial model üõí

*  Client-side: free, open-source.
*  Server-side: freemium (free plan + optional paid SLA plans for medium/large businesses)

We intend to forever support a generous free tier of Dappros Platform for startups, small businesses and non-profit organizations.
Additionally, AWS Marketplace self-hosted option is also available for those who prefer to host the whole solution independently.
