# Ethora: open-source low-code app engine
Mobile üì± + Web/desktop üíª web3 üåê social üí¨ platform for your community. 

[ iOS/Android | social sign-on | wallet | ERC-20/NFT | messaging/push/calls | gamification ]

Simply:<br />
(1) clone this repo OR use our web builder<br />
(2) change logo, colors, things like Firebase ID<br />
(3) get your own iOS, Android and Web apps ready to fly!<br /> 
<br />
Coding experience is optional, but those experienced in React Native or React.js are welcome to dive deeper and adjust any functionality for your needs.

---

### üí° All the things you can do! 

Some ideas of what you can build with Ethora engine:
* a social / community app with chat rooms
* a wallet app for digital assets (coins, NFTs) or documents (PDF, health reports etc)
* loyalty points & rewards app
* chat bot / ChatGPT consulting app
* p2p social commerce and business networking app
* gamificaiton of [anything] app
* fans app (sport clubs, celebrities) - communication, collectibles, 2nd screen
* DAO / charity governance - voting and crowd-funding via bots, governance tokens and DAO smart contracts
* digital identity / KYC / pass app (NFT / QR based)

Startups, communities and enterprises come to use Ethora engine so they can deliver their MVP (minimum viable product) app quickly, within DAYS as opposed to months or even years when building a similar functionality from scratch. This engine is fully production ready too, powering multiple projects live in Apple and Google appstores. Backend: comes with a generous free tier (Dappros Platform). Self-hosted (AWS marketplace) and enterprise-grade SLA options available. Experimental 'no backend' (Ethereum and Polygon) versions available too.

### Chat bots (ChatGPT, DAO voting, NFT minting, bookings/reminders, commerce etc)

You can easily extend your Ethora-based app with chat bots. This is a fantastic way to implement additional functionality without changing a single line of code in the engine itself.

We use XMPP protocol and this means you can easily connect to chat rooms, interact with your Users and digital assets via your own chat bots logic. Your chat bots can be written in Python, Node.js or anything really that is capable to interact with XMPP. In this repo (https://github.com/dappros/ethora/tree/main/bots section)  you will find some sample bots built using Ethora Bots Framework. This Framework is a scaffolding (currently in Node.js but more languages coming) that absctracts away the mundande tasks allowing you to focus on the core logic of your bots. 

ChatGPT bot<br />
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 11 01 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/328787/236429436-a1046904-b342-44e8-98a9-c269eb42857b.png">

A standard OpenAI / ChatGPT integration is demonstrated in our /bots/ section. With customizations, you can add a ChatGPT / LLM powered bot specialized in your project topic. 

Translate bot<br />

An example of an interpreter bot that translates to/from English and Spanish so that users can chat each in their own language and still understand each other.

### Branding and customization

Ethora offers many branding options for app owners. You can easily change things such as your app name, logo, theme colours, Coin name and symbol etc. These things you can change using our App builder UI without even having to code.

For further customizations, you can dive into the code of Ethora engine and make modifications as your project requires.

Another plane for content ownership and customizations is at Users level. Users have a variety of options to customize Chat rooms they own/admin, their Profiles and asset collections. As project owner, you can disable or enable some of these features depending on your project requirements.

Custom chat background<br />

### Threads

For chats with lots of conversations, threads mechanism is supported meaning that groups of users can continue discussing threads which are relevant to them without spamming the main room with all the follow-up messages:<br />

### Gamification, referrals and rewards

Ethora is all for sticky, long-lasting and self-supporting communities. 
There are gamification features that work out of the box, for example:
* Coin - your own project coin based on secure ERC-20 crypto protocol - BTW you can call it anything you want so it can be 'stars', 'points', 'credits' or whatever you like. 
* Sign up bonus - 100 Coins (by default) for all users who join your app
* Daily activity bonus - 5 Coins (by default) for all users who check in at least once per day
* Referral bonus - 25 Coins each for User and their friend who join the app using their invite code


Referrals<br />
<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 11 35 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/328787/236436264-e8f57960-6995-41dd-a708-f66d7ff4fc41.png">

Somewhat related to gamification, digital collectibles and token economy options available and fully supported by Ethora via digital assets (handled via smart contracts and NFT collections). This is covered in detail in a separate section. 

And last, but not least, you can build your own custom gamification mechanics via adding your own backend or bots logic. 
Ethora already offers some gamification bots such as:

* Prison - you can play Prisoner Dilemma with other players or a chat bot for Coin
* Raffle bot - you can pay for a raffle ticket and have a chance to win a prize
* Hut, hut - Users can hide their assets (NFTs or Documents) in a Hut. Other Users can pay Coin for a chance to find such items

### Rewarding Users with Coin and digital collectibles (video demo, 1.5 minutes):

(enable subtitles to see explanations)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=pKEMcxJb5HM" target="_blank"><img width="439" alt="ethora_youtube" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/328787/185500847-3a607707-9008-4c56-873c-7c9aa1aa1eee.png"></a>

This video demo shows how Users can reward each other with Coin or digital collectibles. 
Another user has shared some useful information? Just long tap on their message and choose to reward them with Coins or a send them an NFT item.

In group / public chat rooms, this mechanism doubles as 'likes' or 'merit' social metric. Messages that are more useful to the community will receive more rewards and attention.

Note: Coins are based on ERC-20 tokens and items/collectibles are NFTs (ERC-1155). Coins, Items and Documents in Ethora are all protected by blockchain (EVM) technology - same technology as global digital currencies, cryptographically protected provenance trail for all transactions and so on.

Depending on your project and whether your user base is savvy in web3 technology, you may:
a) Keep it simple. Only use this for gamification and peer-to-peer 'merit' mechanics.
b) Allow your users to purchase or trade features, items and collectibles internally using their earned Coin and items.
c) Allow your users to export/import Coins and assets to/from external world via blockchain, enabling a global token economy for your project.
