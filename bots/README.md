## Ethora Chat Bots (powered by XMPP, Ethora API and Web3 features)

This directory includes some sample and/or production-ready chat bots for different purposes.

These chat bots leverage Ethora API, XMPP messaging protocol and Web3.js (or Web3.py) libraries for their functionality.

3rd party developers may write their own bots based on our examples or from scratch, in order to extend the functionality of Ethora engine.
